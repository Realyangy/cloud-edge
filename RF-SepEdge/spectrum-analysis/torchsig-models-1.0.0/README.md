# TorchSig Models

**TorchSig Models** provides pre-trained models and utilities for working with [TorchSig](https://github.com/TorchDSP/torchsig) data. This library includes model architectures, training scripts, and adapters for integrating TorchSig with popular deep learning frameworks like YOLO and Anomalib.

## Features

- **Pre-trained models** for narrowband and wideband signal classification
- **Adapters** for YOLO, Anomalib, and other frameworks
- **Training utilities** including metrics tracking and reproducibility tools
- **Easy integration** with existing TorchSig datasets

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The datasets generated can be very large (562 GB for narrowband and 396 GB for wideband), so ensure your device has adequate storage before running the scripts.

- Ubuntu &ge; 22.04 (recommended)
- Hard drive storage with 1 TB (for full datasets)
- CPU with &ge; 4 cores
- GPU with &ge; 16 GB storage (recommended for training)
- Python &ge; 3.10

We recommend using Ubuntu or a Docker container for best compatibility.

### Installation

#### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install torchsig-models
```

#### From Source

Clone the repository and install in development mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TorchDSP/torchsig-models.git
cd torchsig-models
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

#### Using Docker

Build and run the Docker image with GPU support:

```bash
docker build -t torchsig-models -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker run -it --gpus all torchsig-models
```

Note: The Docker image size is ~20.5 GB.

## Docker

Run TorchSig Models within Docker by building the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t torchsig-models -f Dockerfile .
```
Note that the Docker image size is ~20.5 GB.

## Available Models

### Narrowband Models

| Model | Description | Paper |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `XCiTClassifier` | 1D Version of the XCiT Model for signal classification | [arXiv:2106.09681](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09681) |

### Wideband Models

| Model | Description | Paper |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| YOLO11n | YOLO-based detector for wideband signal detection | [arXiv:1506.02640](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) |

## Usage

### Quick Start

```python
import torchsig_models
from torchsig_models.models import XCiTClassifier
from torchsig_models.adapters import yolo_train, yolo_infer
from torchsig_models.utils import ClassifierMetricsTracker

# Initialize a model
model = XCiTClassifier(num_classes=24)

# Use training utilities
metrics_tracker = ClassifierMetricsTracker(num_classes=24)
```

### Using YOLO Adapter

```python
from pathlib import Path
from torchsig_models.adapters import yolo_train, yolo_infer

# Train a YOLO model
config_path = Path("path/to/yolo_config.yaml")
output_dir = Path("output/directory")
model_path = Path("yolo11n.pt")

yolo_train(
    model_filepath=model_path,
    config=config_path,
    output_dir=output_dir,
    epochs=25
)

# Run inference
yolo_infer(
    output_dir=output_dir,
    config=config_path,
    split="val"
)
```

### Using Anomalib Adapter

```python
from torchsig_models.adapters import TorchSigAnomalibDataset

# Create an Anomalib-compatible dataset from TorchSig data
dataset = TorchSigAnomalibDataset(
    root="path/to/torchsig/dataset",
    task="classification",
    split="train"
)
```
